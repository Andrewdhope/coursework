## Would you rather be:
- Underpaid?  

Or  

- Overrated?

## For your viewing pleasure

This application, presented in Shiny, allows the user to visualize which NBA players are paid more or less than their statistical contributions suggest they are worth.

- Data retrieved from the nbastatr package.
- The predictions are generated form a multivariate linear regression, using traditional box-score statistics.
- The user can select between models based on player career totals, or per game averages.

## Slide with R code

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
print("Here's where I throw in some r code...")
```

## Without further ado
